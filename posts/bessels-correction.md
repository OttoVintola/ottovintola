## Population and Sample Covariance

Covariance is a statistical measure of scatter. 
Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables and let $x_i$ and $y_i$ be samples from each respective variable, then population covariance can be calculated as
$$
\text{COV(X, Y)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n},
$$
