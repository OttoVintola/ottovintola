## Inception

When I was twelve years old, I built my first computer with the help of my dad. It had an Intel Core i7-4770 that I immediately overclocked—and still keep overclocked to this day. It had two sticks of 8 GB RAM and a GTX 780 plugged into an ASUS Z87. All of these components cost around 1700€ back in 2013, when GPUs were mainly for gaming—AlexNet [@10.5555/2999134.2999257] released one year prior to this in ILSVRC 2012 [@russakovsky2015imagenet].

We used an SSD that had 256 GB and installed Windows 7 on it. Throughout the years, it was upgraded to Windows 8.1 and then subsequently to Windows 10 which I did not use 
a great deal because I had adopted a MacBook as my day-to-day computer by that point. Consequently, the desktop laid dormant, until recently.
