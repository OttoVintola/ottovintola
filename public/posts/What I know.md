## I'm an engineer, not a poet

I love my family – especially the dog. I know I love them because I would do anything for them and I would not let anything bad happen to them. I know they will always be there for me like I will always be there for them –we can always count on each other, there is never a feeling of debt or neglect when we are together.

## I have another confession to make

Sometimes there are people who fall in love. It is not like falling off a mountain or falling into a river. It is more like a climb to the top of a mountain. I am not talking about crushes or anything like that – usually they are just a feeling of infatuation.

## Has someone taken my faith

No one knows where they belong and what the future will hold for them. I do not know where I'm headed. I sometimes wonder what its like to be found in someones diary. Everyone has their chains to break. I need someone to help me find my way. I don't want to keep starting again.

## It doesn't really matter

In Camus' book the Stranger the protagonist is indifferent to everything. He does not care about his mother's death, he does not care about his girlfriend, he does not care about his job. He is indifferent to everything. He is indifferent to life. Personally, I am not a nihilist – life is not whatever. Sitting on the dock and watching it roll by, is not for me. I will make life what I want it to be, however, somethings are out of our control.

## Letting someone get the best of you

I am too weak to give in. I wish I could give in – to lose. I wish I could let someone behind me. To go to a place where the lost days are just a memory. What do you want to know about me?
