# Understanding Variational Autoencoders

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a fascinating class of deep learning models that combine probabilistic graphical models with neural networks. They allow us to both compress data into a learned continuous latent representation and generate new samples from that learned distribution. Variational autoencoders are cool [@kingma2013]

## The Math Behind VAEs

The core idea of VAEs revolves around the variational lower bound:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z))
$$

Where:
- $q_\phi(z|x)$ is our encoder (recognition model)
- $p_\theta(x|z)$ is our decoder (generative model)
- $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence

## Implementation Insights

The practical implementation usually involves:

1. An encoder network that outputs μ and σ
2. A reparameterization trick: $z = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon$
3. A decoder network that reconstructs the input

Here's a visual representation:

This architecture allows for both efficient inference and generation of new samples.
