## How to upload a post

### Step 1: Create a new post

1. Create a new file in the `posts` directory with a `.md` extension. The **title** should be the same as the postMap key but with dashes instead of spaces. For example, if the title is "Understanding Variational Autoencoders", the file name should be `variational-autoencoders.md`. The .md file can have any name you want. 

2. Update the json files (posts.json and images.json)

3. Update the postMap and bibMap (optional) in PostPage.js.

4. Upload a thumbnail image to the `../assets/image_name.image_extension`
